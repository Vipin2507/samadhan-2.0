# Day 2: Functions & Loops

👨‍💻 Today I learned about **functions, conditionals, and loops** in JavaScript.  
Functions help us reuse code, and loops allow us to repeat actions multiple times.

---

## 📚 What I Learned
1. Functions are blocks of reusable code.
2. Conditionals (`if`, `else if`, `else`) help us make decisions.
3. Loops like `for`, `while`, and `forEach` help us repeat actions.
4. Arrays can be traversed using loops to find values like maximum, minimum, etc.

---

## 📝 Mini Task
Find the **highest marks** from an array using loops.

---

## 🔑 Example Codes

### functions.js
Basic function with conditionals.

### loops.js
Examples of `for`, `while`, and `forEach`.

### highestMarks.js
Mini task: Find the highest marks from an array.

## ▶️ Run the Programs
```bash
node functions.js
node loops.js
node highestMarks.js
