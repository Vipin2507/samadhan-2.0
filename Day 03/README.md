# Day 3: Arrays & Objects

👨‍💻 Today I dove deeper into JavaScript with **Arrays and Objects**. The array methods like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` are incredibly powerful for working with data.

### 📚 What I Learned
1.  **Array Methods**:
    * `.map()`: Creates a new array by performing an action on each element of the old array.
    * `.filter()`: Creates a new array with only the elements that pass a certain condition.
    * `.reduce()`: Reduces an array to a single value (like summing up numbers).
2.  **Nested Objects**: Objects can contain other objects, which is great for organizing complex data like a student's profile.

### 📝 Mini Task
Create a **Simple Student Marks Calculator**. The goal was to take an object containing a student's marks in different subjects and calculate the total marks using the `.reduce()` method.

### 🔑 Example Codes
* `arrayMethods.js`: Practice using `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`.
* `nestedObjects.js`: Example of how to create and access data from a nested object.
* `marksCalculator.js`: Solution for the mini-task to calculate total marks.

### ▶️ Run the Programs
```bash
node arrayMethods.js
node nestedObjects.js
node marksCalculator.js
