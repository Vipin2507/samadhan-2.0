# Day 1: JavaScript Basics

👨‍💻 Today I started with the basics of JavaScript.  
I learned about **variables, data types, operators**, and also wrote my **first Node.js script** using `console.log`.

## 📚 What I Learned
1. Variables in JS can be declared using `let`, `const`, and `var`.
2. JavaScript has basic types like `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `array`, and `object`.
3. Operators help us perform operations like addition, subtraction, etc.
4. Node.js lets us run JavaScript outside the browser.

## 📝 Mini Task
Create a `student` object and print its details using `console.log`.
